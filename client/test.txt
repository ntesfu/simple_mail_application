The character b has no effect, but is allowed for ISO C standard conformance. Opening a file with read mode (r as the first character in the mode argument) fails if the file does not exist or cannot be read.
Opening a file with append mode (a as the first character in the mode argument) causes all subsequent writes to the file to be forced to the then current end-of-file, regardless of intervening calls to fseek().
When a file is opened with update mode (+ as the second or third character in the mode argument), both input and output may be performed on the associated stream. However, output must not be directly followed 
by input without an intervening call to fflush() or to a file positioning function (.Fn fseek , fsetpos() or rewind()), and input must not be directly followed by output without an intervening call to a file 
positioning function, unless the input operation encounters end-of-file.
